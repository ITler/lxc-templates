lxc-templates
=============

Repository containing lxc-templates and extensions as a proof-of-concept.
Basically it contains wrapper templates for existing ones shipped with LXC. 
The idea is to separate custom extensions from original templates giving a flexible approach for infrastructure specific modification.
